# Flying_Whales
Concept Paper
Genre: Platform
Description: A game where you have two levels one open world and then the other a straight level where you need to keep switching in order to collect items that will allow you to unlock abilities to get to new levels
Key Features: 
Sprinting: 
First ability you will get after you collect something from the crash level you can buy it from a character on Spyro. 
Double Jump: 
After buying sprinting you will be able to do a puzzle where you have a timed tasks to destroy all items, this will unlock a chest that will give you double jump, which should allow you to get to a new area on Crash
Crouching:
Once you finish the double jump area on crash you will get something that will unlock a gate where you will have to solve another puzzle(TBD) in order to get crouching, this should allow you to get to the final area on Crash
(we can make attack a collectible as well, originally already from the beginning)
